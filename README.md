* `images/`, where content images are stored;
* `css/`, where css stylesheet are stored;
* `js/`, where Javascript client-side scripts are stored;
* `data/`, where documents and other binary stuff are stored;

The `resources` directories contains all the back-end. It contains the directory `library` where are stored php scripts. The `library` directory's structure is shown below:

* `model/`, which contains script for database management;
* `controller/`, which contains script to generate page sections and communicate with model;
* `utils/`, which contains other php classes;
* `vendor/`, which contains external libraries from package manager composer;Ã¹
* `composer.json` file, which contains the description of the package;

You can also find `backup/` directory inside `resources` folder. It contains all backup files, such as mysql backups.
